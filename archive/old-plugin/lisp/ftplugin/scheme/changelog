- made the "sysread of tty returned undef" when you exit the interpreter
  conditional on $debug
- added "stty sane" on exit of funnel.pl.  cmucl lisp doesn't need it, but
  apparently at least one Octave or R user does.

- change wincol() to vircol(".").  Allows use of ":set nu" and may fix other
  problems
- Use "normal!" instead of "normal" everywhere, so as to avoid any problems
  with user-defined mappings
